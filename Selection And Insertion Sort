## Time Complexity and  Big O Nation

Best Case	O(n^2)

Average Case	O(n^2)

Worst Case	O(n^2)

o	Best Case Complexity - It occurs when there is no sorting required, the array is already sorted. The best-case time complexity of selection sort is O(n^2).

o	Average Case Complexity - It occurs when the array elements are in jumbled order that is not properly ascending and not properly descending. The average case time complexity of selection sort is O(n^2).

o	Worst Case Complexity - It occurs when the array elements are required to be sorted in reverse order. That means suppose you have to sort the array elements in ascending order, but its elements are in descending order. The worst-case time complexity of selection sort is O(n^2).

## Time Complexity and  Big O Nation

Best Case	O(n) - the array is already sorted.

Average Case	O(n^2)

Worst Case	O(n^2) - In Worst Case when the array is reversly sorted.

## Which case for 18?
Since it is in the middle of the array 18 is in the scope of the avarage case
